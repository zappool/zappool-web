# What is Zappool?

Zappool is

> a mining pool
> 
> supporting Bitaxes and other small homeminers,
> 
> with daily payouts,
> 
> integrated with Nostr & cashu,
> 
> using Ocean as an upstream pool (proxypool & motherpool).

Use your BitAxe to generate daily sats, ready for zapping!


# Why?

Traditionally BitAxes are used in solo mode, which means most users don't get any earnings from them (but who is lucky can get a huge win). Pooled mining can be more complicated to set up, and since the rewards are quite small, may not worth the effort.

Zaps on Nostr are a perfect use case for the mined sats, and if the setup is easy, your BitAxe becomes a zap mine!


# Other Goals

- Help popularize Nostr and BitAxe

- Push for Zappool features to end up in other/upstream pools

- Set an example, and help others to run proxy pools

- Make a step towards fully permissionless, non-custodial, non-proxy mining pool -- see [Hashpool](https://hashpool.dev)

- Ultimately, Help miner decentralization
